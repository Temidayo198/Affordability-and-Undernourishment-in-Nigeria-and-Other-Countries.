### Project Overview
---
This project explores the affordability of a healthy diet and its relationship with undernourishment across different countries, focusing on Nigeria, USA and United Kingdom. The analysis examines factors such as the cost of a healthy diet, food price anomalies and their impact on diet accessibility and public health. By identifying key trends and disparities, this study provides evidence based insights and recommendations to policymakers for improving food affordability and addressing global undernutrition challenges.

### Project Objectives
---
1. Examine the affordability of a healthy diet.
2. Analyze the prevalence of undernourishment and its correlation with food prices.
3. Identify key factors influencing high food prices.
4. Understand the health implications of unaffordable diets.
5. Provide evidence-based recommendations to policymakers and stakeholders to address high food prices, enhance diet affordability, and improve public health outcomes.

### Data Source
---
The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from Amdor Analytics. It includes metrics on food affordability, undernourishment, and employment sectors

### Tool Used
---
- PowerBI
  
1. Data Integration
2. Data Transformation
3. Data Visualization

###  Data Analysis Process
---

Data Integration: This involve downloading the dataset as excel file and uploading it into PowerBI.

Data Transformation: Once the data was loaded, I cleaned my dataset using Power Query Editor.

Data Visualization: The use of various visual elements (charts, graphs, cards) to represent data visually.

### Actionable Insights
---

 **1. Cost of a Healthy Diet per Year**

- **Nigeria:** The cost of a healthy diet is significantly higher relative to average income, making it unaffordable for a large portion of the population.
- **USA:** The cost is comparatively lower as a percentage of income, making nutritious diets more accessible to most households.

**2. Indicator of Food Price Anomalies**
- **Nigeria:**: Food price anomalies occur frequently, driven by supply chain disruptions, inflation, and environmental factors.
- **USA:** Food prices are more stable, though occasional anomalies are influenced by external factors like global market shifts.

 **3. Share of the Population Who Cannot Afford a Healthy Diet**
- **Nigeria:** A significant proportion of the population cannot afford a healthy diet, contributing to widespread undernourishment.
- **USA:** A smaller share of the population struggles with affordability due to economic safety nets and lower relative food costs.

**4. Prevalence of Undernourishment**
- **Nigeria:** Undernourishment rates are high, driven by the inability to afford healthy diets and limited access to food.
- **USA:** Undernourishment is rare but still present among certain low-income or marginalized populations.

 **5. Percentage of Employment in Different Sectors**
- **Nigeria:** A large workforce in agriculture does not translate to improved food affordability due to inefficiencies and limited industrial growth.
- **USA:** A balanced employment distribution across industry and services contributes to economic resilience and greater purchasing power.

### **Country-Specific Actions and Recommendations**

### **Actions**

#### **Nigeria**
1. Implement financial assistance programs (e.g., food vouchers, cash transfers) for low-income households.
2. Promote local food production to reduce reliance on expensive imports.
3. Establish price stabilization mechanisms like buffer stock programs and import/export regulations.
4. Strengthen food storage and distribution infrastructure to reduce supply chain disruptions.
5. Invest in agricultural technology to increase productivity and lower food costs.

#### **USA**
1. Continue supporting financial assistance programs for low-income groups.
2. Encourage public-private partnerships to create affordable, nutritious food options.
3. Implement price stabilization measures to prevent sudden food price fluctuations.
4. Invest in food storage and distribution systems to minimize supply chain disruptions.
5. Expand community-based nutrition programs to reach underserved populations.

### **Recommendations**

#### **Nigeria**
1. Governments should incentivize farmers to produce diverse, nutrient-rich crops.
2. Policymakers should regulate market prices for essential food items.
3. Focus on expanding school feeding programs to improve child nutrition.
4. Strengthen vocational training to upskill workers and increase job opportunities.
5. Collaborate with NGOs to distribute affordable food packages in underserved areas.

#### **USA**
1. Develop local initiatives like urban farming to improve food access in cities.
2.. Encourage private businesses to lower food production costs to benefit low-income households.
3. Implement policies to prevent food price volatility and support price stabilization.
4. Strengthen partnerships between the public and private sectors to improve food affordability.
